# Project 2
+ By: Nicola Gallagher
+ Production URL: <http://e2p2.nicolaphp.me>

## Outside resources
+ **ucupper()**: I referred to W3Schools, <https://www.w3schools.com/php/func_string_ucwords.asp>, to learn how to use the built in PHP function, ucupper, to capitalize the first letter of a string.

## Notes for instructor
+ **Keeping determineWinner() function at the end of the code:** Although I only call this function once, I chose to keep it refactored out of my code, as I thought removing the complex function helped with readability of my code. I also think that going forward, if this game is built upon, it would be helpful to have the function separate as the game becomes more complex.
+ Thank you again for your support with Project 2! It's exciting to try different methods/ ways of making code more concise and efficient.
