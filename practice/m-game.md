I would like to try to come up with some sort of game related to public health.
Modified: rock, paper, scissors; malaria interventions/outputting country where those interventions are utilized?
    # Two people could be talking about malaria interventions, each 'selects' an intervention, game outputs country(s) where interventions are utilized
    # Final project could look like (might be too advanced/not game like enough): user can input/select interventions and see an updated map of where those interventions are utilized.
Set values (or have boolean statements) for three main intervetions: spraying, nets, intermittent medicine
Randomly assign value to each person, set as new variable (person_a, person_b)
If/else statements to determine which countries to output
    Add logic of which lists/arrays to access of the countries
echo results (countries where interventions occur) of the game to the html
game refreshers when the broswer is refreshed

<h1>Malaria Interventions Game</h1>
<p>
    There are different malaria treatment and prevention interventions for different locations.
</p>
<h2>Mechanics</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Person A and Person B randomly select a malaria intervention type: residual spraying, nets, or medicine
        treatment.</li>
    <li>Depending on the type of malaria intervention selected, a list of countries will be outputted that use those
        interventions.</li>
    <li>If person A and B select the same malaria intervention type, a list of countries will be outtputted for that
        intervention.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Results</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Person A selected TBD</li>
    <li>Person B selected TBD</li>
    <li>Countries that utilize that intervention.</li>
</ul>
