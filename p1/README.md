## Game planning
+ Create an array with the *moves* of the game, with three elements: Rock, Paper, Scissors
+ For Player A, choose a random element from the *moves* array
+ For Player B, choose a random element frm the *moves* array
+ Compare Player A and Player B's moves to determine if it is a tie or if there is a winner.
++ If the moves match, it is a tie.
++ Else, compare the moves. Rock beats scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock.
+ In the view, report the results: Player A's move, Player B's move, the winner
