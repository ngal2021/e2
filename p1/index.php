# I would like to try to come up with some sort of game related to public health.
# Modified: rock, paper, scissors; malaria interventions/outputting country where those interventions are utilized?
    # Two people could be talking about malaria interventions, each 'selects' an intervention, game outputs country(s) where interventions are utilized

# Set values (or have boolean statements) for three main intervetions: spraying, nets, intermittent medicine
# Randomly assign value to each person, set as new variable (person_a, person_b)
# If/else statements to determine which countries to output
    # Add logic of which lists/arrays to access of the countries
# echo results (countries where interventions occur) of the game to the html
